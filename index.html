							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<p align="justify">
							I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Astronomy from the Universidad de Concepción. I began my undergraduate studies in 2018, where I built a strong foundation in astrophysics and observational techniques. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I pursued a Master's program, which I successfully finished in January 2024. 
							Throughout my academic journey, I actively engaged with the international scientific community, presenting my research at international conferences:
						</p>
							<lu>
								<li> XVII Latin American Regional IAU Meeting (LARIM), Uruguay, 2023 </li>
								<li> 65th Annual Meeting of the Asociación Argentina de Astronomía (AAA), Argentina, 2023</li>
								<li>XVIII SOCHIAS Meeting, Chile, 2022</li>
							</lu> <br>
							<p align="justify">
							At these events, I contributed through posters and oral presentations, showcasing my research.


							In addition to my academic studies, I gained invaluable hands-on experience through internships and research visits to prestigious institutions:
						</p>

							<lu>
								<li>Internship at Carnegie Observatories, Pasadena, California, USA (14 April–15 March 2023)</li>
								<li>Research visit to SISSA, Trieste, Italy (30 September–7 October 2023)</li>
								<li>Research visit to Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie, Heidelberg, Germany (9–27 October 2023)</li>
							</lu>
							<p  align="justify">

							These experiences provided me with exposure to cutting-edge research environments, and computational methodologies.

							I have also contributed to teaching and outreach activities during my studies. I participated in tutoring sessions, where I supported undergraduate and graduate students by mentoring and guiding them through challenging coursework. These experiences honed my communication skills and deepened my commitment to education and scientific dissemination.

							Currently, I am on a new chapter in my academic career as a PhD student at Sapienza University of Rome. This opportunity was made possible by a prestigious fellowship awarded by ANID Chile.

								 My research focuses on the formation and growth of supermassive black holes within nuclear star clusters, employing semi-analytical techniques to explore these processes. This work leverages the Galacticus semi-analytic model, which provides a comprehensive framework for simulating galaxy formation and evolution. A thorough understanding of galaxy formation is essential for accurately modeling the environments that foster the growth of supermassive black holes, including the interplay of star clusters, gas dynamics, and dark matter halos.
